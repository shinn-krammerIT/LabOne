What have I learnt?
This week I learnt the history and basics of JavaScript. Specifically how to setup a .JS file,mathematical commands and Global and Local Variables. 

Why have I learnt this?
I have learnt this to start using JavaScript at my main format of code. Setting up a JavaScript file is essential to begin writing its code. Mathematical symbol commands are important for connecting strings and formulating values. Variables are the basis for assigning tags (strings) and values.

How have I learnt this?
I've learnt this through creating multiple JS files within git repositories  and developing  a number of formulas then executing them through VS's terminal shell and examining the results.   

What do I know now that I didn't know before?
I know the very basic format of JavaScript and how to execute a node JavaScript file Within  the VS terminal.

What is the point?
I am now relearning how to  develop code through Java Script as I have previously learnt code through Python. It is good that I am learning Javascript now since it will be used extensively through this course.

What will I do to remember this learning?
Continue practicing and using JavaScript. I am really enjoying the Free code camp website at the moment. It's really easy to read and understand.

What new understanding/skills have you gained?
Very basic Javascript.

What are the real life/work applications?
use of Javascript in the IT industry. 

What will I do to fill in anygaps in my understanding?
I will keep a list of resources such as MDN, Free Code Camp, Code Combat and more. MDN can for when I am stuck on specific commands and functions and interactive sites like FCC and Code Combat will keep me up to practice.
